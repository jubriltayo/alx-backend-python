# Python Generators 
This project demonstrates efficient data handling and advanced Python programming techniques by leveraging **generators** to manage large datasets, simulate real-world scenarios, and optimize performance.

---

## **About the Project**  
The Python Generators project introduces foundational and advanced usage of the `yield` keyword in Python to:  
- Stream data iteratively.  
- Perform memory-efficient batch processing.  
- Simulate lazy-loading for paginated data.  
- Calculate aggregate functions without overloading memory.  

It emphasizes practical applications of Python generators in real-world data processing scenarios.

## **Learning Objectives**   
- **Master Generators**: Build and deploy Python generators for iterative data processing.  
- **Handle Large Datasets**: Stream and process extensive data using batch processing and lazy loading.  
- **Simulate Real-time Operations**: Create generators for live updates and streaming contexts.  
- **Optimize Performance**: Implement memory-efficient computations for aggregate functions.  
- **Integrate SQL with Python**: Fetch data dynamically and manage robust database connections.  

---

## **Requirements**  
- **Python 3.x**: Proficiency in Python generator functions using `yield`.  
- **Database Knowledge**: Basic SQL, database schema design, and usage of MySQL/SQLite.  
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for submission and collaboration.

## **Project Tasks**  
### **1. Setting Up and Streaming SQL Data**  
- **Objective**: Create a generator to stream rows from an SQL database table (`user_data`) one by one.  
- **Key Deliverables**:  
  - Script to connect, create, and populate an SQL database.  
  - Generator to stream rows from the database iteratively.  

---

### **2. Batch Processing Large Data**  
- **Objective**: Develop a generator to fetch data in batches and process it to filter users by specific criteria (e.g., age > 25).  
- **Key Deliverables**:  
  - Batch fetching of users from SQL.  
  - Optimized processing using generators to improve memory efficiency.  

---

### **3. Lazy Loading with Pagination**  
- **Objective**: Implement lazy loading for paginated data, fetching pages only when needed.  
- **Key Deliverables**:  
  - Pagination logic using generators.  
  - Support for dynamic page size and offset.  

---

### **4. Memory-Efficient Aggregation**  
- **Objective**: Use a generator to compute the average age of users from a large dataset without loading the entire dataset into memory.  
- **Key Deliverables**:  
  - Generator function to stream user ages.  
  - Function to calculate and display the average age.
